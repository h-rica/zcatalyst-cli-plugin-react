# Fork Notice

## About This Project

This fork was created to:

1. **Add Vite Support**: Enable developers to use Vite with Catalyst projects
2. **Maintain Compatibility**: Keep 100% backward compatibility with existing Webpack projects
3. **Modernize Architecture**: Introduce an adapter pattern for extensibility
4. **Improve Developer Experience**: Provide automatic build tool detection
